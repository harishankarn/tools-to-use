To set up key type :

 [ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" ]

Directory ~/.ssh will be created

Find [ ~/.ssh/*.pub ] or type that command

The content in the .pub file is your device specific ssh key
Now copy the ssh key.

Log in to Gitlab and click on your profile - preferences - ssh keys

Then paste the ssh key, set the title for that particular device
(expiration date of key if needed) and add key.

If all is done correct your should now be able to clone the repo
when cloning with ssh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we start commiting to the repo we must set the accounts 
identity so that git can make a track of who made the changes 
in the repo

To set identity run the following code :
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Now your account identity has been set and you can proceed to make 
change in the repo
